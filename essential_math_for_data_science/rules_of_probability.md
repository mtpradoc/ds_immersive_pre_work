# Rules of Probability

You've got a six-sided die and some time to kill. What's the likelihood that you'll roll a 3? A 5? How about a 2? In this lesson, we'll review some of the foundational concepts of probability - i.e., the likelihood of an event occurring.

Topics
- Set Theory
- Rules of Probability
- Joint Probability
- Conditional Probability

Reglas de Probabilidad

Tienes un dado de seis caras y algo de tiempo libre. Cuál es la probabilidad de que saques un 3? Un 5? O un 2? En esta lección, repasaremos algunos de los conceptos fundamentales de la probailidad, es decir, la probabilidad de que ocurra un evento.

Temas
- Teoría de Conjuntos
- Reglas de Probabilidad
- Probabilidad Conjunta
- Probabilidad Condicional

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:

- Define the rules of probability using real-world examples.
- Explore set theory and implement it in Python.

## Probability IRL

Let's say you're watching the news and the weather report comes on.

Would you ever hear the phrase,

"There's a negative 12% chance of rain"?

Or,

"There's a 130% chance of rain"?

... we're guessing you wouldn't.

Those phrases don't exist because of the *rules of probability*.

## The Rules of Probability

There are three rules of probability that are always true:

1. The probability (likelihood) of an event can't be less than 0. That's why you'd never hear, "Negative 12% chace of rain".
2. The probability of an event can't be greater than 1. That's why you'd never hear, "130% chance of rain".
3. The union (or sum) of all possible, mutually exclusive outcomes must equal 1.

Let's make an example of No. 3. Let's say you have a fair coin:

- There are two possible outcomes: heads or tails.
- The probability of each is 50%, or 0.5.
- The union of these two possible events is 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.

## Set Theory

Probability relies on something called *set theory*.

A set is
